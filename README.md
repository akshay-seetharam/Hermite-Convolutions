# Status
We should all be reading Chapter 7 for now so we know how to approach the problem.

## Abi

## Owen

## Akshay
- Finished reading Chapter 7 (message for notes!)
- Wrote preliminary buggy code to generate Hermite Polynomials
- Wrote some math that can be added to the repository later

# Hermite-Convolutions
For solving the computational challenge in module 6 of 2021-22 Ted's Linear Alegbra class

# Results
When we add results we'll add them here. The Jupyter Notebook will contain all the nitty-gritty derivations but this will serve as a summary.
